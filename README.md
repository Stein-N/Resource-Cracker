### Provides Items and Tweaks to make your life in Minecraft easier.

At first this Mod is heavily inspired by [Resource Tools by kwpugh](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resource-tools-fabric). <br>
But since he is still on break, I decided to create my own Mod with similar Blocks/Items/Features and some additions i had in mind.

- Craft Crack Hammers to crush vanilla ores into dust and double them.
- Sharpen your Chisel to scratch of saltpeter from Bricks Blocks
- Harvest Crops much faster with your Scythe
- Garlic as additional food or smelt them to gain Sulfur
- Garlic can be dropped by Zombies
- Craft Gunpowder with Sulfur, Saltpeter and Charcoal
- Craft Slimeballs with Honeycomb, Cactus Green and Saltpeter
- Get Leather by smelting/blasting Rotten Flesh
- Smoke Rotten Flesh to get Beef Jerky
- Change nearly all drop chances in the config

### Most used Textures are made by [Malcom Riley](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures).
